# INTAC Alumni Platform - Questions

- what happens if the collaborator does not belong a school? I need a "school" field to be allocated to the collaborator- maybe as indepent? - also a logo for the non-school field.

- When user logs in, but is not register send them to a new page to register
- private profile appear blurred in the community page
- create newAlum page to create name and bio, and rewrite user object as register
- clean up the login page UI
- load logos for schools
